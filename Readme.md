Program usage: 

run the exe. it expects 2 parameters. 
 pdfUnlock.exe PathToFile PasswordForPdf

it will save the output in the same directory as the original file appending the filename with Unprotected.pdf

feel free to fork or whatever if this was useful to you. Made it just to make a process a bit less tedious
