Simple CLI tool. I could only find online tools that want you to upload your files to their server. Or pay adobe for this...
so here we are. 
No more need to upload medical data to shady sites so you can forward them to your doctor :)
[Let me know if there is a need for a gui app]

Program usage: 

run the exe. it expects 2 parameters. 
 pdfUnlock.exe PathToFile PasswordForPdf

it will save the output in the same directory as the original file appending the filename with Unprotected.pdf

feel free to fork or whatever if this was useful to you. Made it just to make a process a bit less tedious
